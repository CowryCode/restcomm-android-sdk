Introduction
================
Welcome to the REB Approval Accelerator project! This initiative is aimed at benefiting the esteemed research community of Dalhousie University by streamlining the Research Ethics Board (REB) approval process. By optimizing the approval process, we aim to significantly reduce the turnaround time for researchers through faster ethics approval, thereby fostering a more efficient research environment.

Project Overview
================
The primary objective of this project is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite the review of research ethics approval, through an AI-powered review of the consent form content (which forms a major bottleneck in the process). The APP is a web app with Python API built with the Flask framework as a backend and makes an external call to OpenAI API. The front end is built with HTML and CSS.

Origin
================
The groundwork for this project was laid by an intern within our faculty, who has since transitioned to a role at IBM. Building upon the initial efforts, our team is dedicated to further developing and refining the REB Approval Accelerator.

How You Can Contribute
================
We welcome contributions from freelancers who are passionate about advancing research ethics and accelerating the approval process. Whether you're proficient in coding, AI, or have valuable insights to share, your contributions are highly appreciated.

File Description
================
Contained in this repository are:
- #main.CSS: this file can be found in the "static" folder and controls the design of the front-end. The two logos can be found in this "static" folder as well.
- index.html: this file is the only frontend page,
